# Datacenter Fire 2019
What I learned from a "total loss" data center fire in July 2019
---

In July 2019, the S.P. Richards Co. Atlanta warehouse, headquarters & data center burned down. No one was hurt in what was the biggest fire in the history of the City of Smyrna, Georgia. It's a remarkable first-hand experience. The story and perspective is entirely my own as a manager during the event.

## Top 10 Things I Learned
10 | Pee first.
 9 | Complexity fails fast.
 8 | "Everyone knew..." is BS
 7 | Use physical cards even if you use lists.
 6 | Your Plan B needs a Plan C through Z and so on
 5 | Ask "how are you" and then listen.
 4 | Don't cheap out.
 3 | Over-communicate, but *only* to management.
 2 | When someone says "go home," listen.
 1 | It will change you.

### 10. Pee First
I grew up around volunteer firefighters and would sometimes find myself responding with them. As a trained first responder, that was sometimes helpful. When the alarm rings in a firehouse, the first trip is to pee because you may not have a chance for hours. It's a simple, meditative act that goes along with the axiom that ["paramedics don't run."](https://medium.com/the-innovation/paramedics-dont-run-what-i-ve-learned-from-over-a-decade-as-a-paramedic-90617af54fbc). [Most of us over-estimate how we will handle a crisis.](https://www.webmd.com/balance/features/crisis-how-would-you-respond#1) Start by giving yourself a small edge.

### 9. Complexity Fails Fast
When work begins in crisis mode, simplicity saves time and dollars. A Boeing 747-400 [Normal Procedures Checklst](https://www.onebag.com/popups/747checklist.pdf) fits on 2.5 pages. If there's a DR plan in your quiver (there is, right? please say yes!) that requires careful, delicate handling of multiple dependencies, failure is right around the corner. Once the crisis starts, it's too late to simplify. So simplify now!

### 8. "Everyone knew..." is BS
As humans, we allow a lot of placeholders for things we would like to have done. Film geeks love Akira Kurosawa's classic [Rashomon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashomon) about the abstract "truth" from the perspective of four different people. If that hurts your head reading that here, **take heed.** The trade-offs that "everyone knew" after the tests and during the meetings are out the window.

### 7. Use Physical Cards Even If You Use Lists
Synchronous communication is now a luxury that cannot be afforded for anything but the most critical system coupling. There will be people making lists, hopefully on those awesome, giant 3M Sticky Note boards. That will devolve because it simply becomes too hard to carry messages verbally from team to team. Stop at the store. Get boxes of index cards and sticky notes. Write clearly and slide these next to the people in an impromptu physical queueing system. That way, if they have to pass the work, they have a literal [Kanban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development)) to pass along.

### 6. Your Plan B needs a Plan C through Z and so on
**I.T. is fundamentally a business of contingency planning.** Don't confuse this with [Analysis Paralysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis). Pick a path, execute. But do not forget that *Hope Is Not A Plan.* If you have any doubts about the outcome of what you're trying (and trust me, you'll be trying things you cannot imagine for reasons you cannot conceive), when Plan B starts running, write down your Plan C for if it fails.

### 5. Ask "How Are You?" And Then Listen
Leave space for an answer. [The person you're asking will fill the silence.](https://uproxx.com/life/how-to-listen/) People will be in a bunch of different headspaces, and, speaking from personal experience, cycling through several of them in the span of an hour is the norm. Ask your boss. Ask your folks. Ask the people you tolerate but do not particularly tolerate well, if ya catch my meaning. You will need everyone in some capacity. Let them unburden themselves.

### 4. Don't Cheap Out
So many possible examples, but here's the best one: food. [You're gonna buy a LOT of food, and it's gonna cost a LOT MORE than you think.](https://www.o4wpizza.com/) Eating will be the one luxury most of the sleepless zombies formerly known as co-workers will have. If there are contractors or non-company data center staff, feed them like they're your own family, too. For the next month, they ARE your family. Take care of them!

### 3. Over-Communicate, But *Only* To Management
You won't possibly know enough. The tornadic swirl around you will be confusing, impenetrable, daunting and ever-moving. I promise your boss needs to hear more from you. Start with the [Bottom Line Up Front.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLUF_(communication)) Write short notes as reference, walk them over hourly, review, be patient with the questions. Offer to take them up the chain with other communications. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Do not do this with your folks. Ask what they're working on, ask if they're stuck, get out of the way if they are not.

### 2. When Someone Says "Go Home," Listen
For the first hours, even days, you'll have adrenaline, caffine and sugar to keep you going. And you cannot afford to burn out. [The U.S. Army knows this](https://www.army.mil/article/184721/fighting_fatigue_better_soldiers_through_better_sleep) and they're BETTER at this than you are! When someone tells you to step away, do it. Go home. Put it aside. You're the reserve. You're going to need to be ready to do that, too.

### 1. It Will Change You
So, duh, right? In 2020, we're living through a pandemic. That's changed many of us, so you kinda know what I mean. What I'm trying to say here is that, until you experience this, you just don't know. Case in point, for the first two weeks, my wife said it was the happiest, most purposeful she'd seen me in years. Some of those things stick. Some don't. But you **WILL** be different, and you have to find a way to embrace that.
